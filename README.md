# blackjack_MDP_generalizer
Author: Michael J. Lukiman. Combines adversarial lookahead and Markov Decision Processes to formulate a game of blackjack where card values can range from 1 to a chosen N (instead of 1 to 10 (Jack)) and winning values can be a window of some numbers L to U (instead of just 21).
